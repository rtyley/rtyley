# Expert Witness for Git version-control history remediation


Git's dominant status as a version control system can make it significant in intellectual property disputes, where its behaviour of retaining the full history of all content stored can make history remediation challenging.

The [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) is a popular software tool for Git history remediation which I created and open-sourced in 2013 - GitHub has recommended the BFG Repo-Cleaner for many years:

* https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository

As the author of the BFG Repo-Cleaner, I have specialist knowledge on Git and particularly Git history remediation that allows me to serve as an Expert Witness in these matters.
